# Early-diagnosis-of-Alzhiemer's-disease
This project uses deep learning models like CNN, VGG16, and ResNet to analyze Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans and classify them to detect early signs of the disease.

# Ongoing Developments
This project serves as a foundational step. Currently exploring more advanced architectures, using a larger and more diverse dataset, and integrating the models into a user-friendly application and significantly improve the early diagnosis of Alzheimerâ€™s disease.
